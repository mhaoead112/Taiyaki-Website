# Taiyaki-Website
A full-stack web app that lets users browse, customize, and order Japanese Taiyaki (fish-shaped pastries). Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), it includes animated UI elements, order management, and a responsive design. My goal is to help small food businesses create modern digital experiences.
